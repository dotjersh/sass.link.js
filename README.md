sass.link.js
============

Link SCSS stylesheets directly in your browser (compiled via [lib]sass.js)

Basically a mashup of less.js and sass.js. The part to replace all referenced
scss stylesheets within a page has been taken from less.js. The actual compilation
is done via sass.js.

@imports within SCSS files will not (yet) work!
