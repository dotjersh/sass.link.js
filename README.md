sass.link.js
============

Link SCSS stylesheets directly in your browser (compiled via [lib]sass.js)

    <link href="example.scss" type="text/scss" />
    <script src="../dist/sass.link.min.js"></script>

It is basically a mashup of less.js and sass.js. The part to replace all referenced
scss stylesheets inside a page has been taken from less.js. The actual compilation
is done via sass.js (which is libsass to js via emscripten). Pretty amazing!


Imports within scss
===================

I had to patch the sass.js library to have a hook to load requested files by synchronous
XHR. This is expensive, as libsass tries to stat all possible names and does not seem to
abort the loop when one candidate is found.
